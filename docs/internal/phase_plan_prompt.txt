**LLM NOTICE: Do not read or modify this file unless explicitly instructed by the user.

You are assisting with a software engineering task.
Your goal is to produce an implementation brief for a specific phase of Agent Engine.
You must NOT generate the implementation plan unless all required details are present.

Goal

Evaluate whether the provided context is sufficient to create:

PHASE_<N>_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md


If any required information is missing or ambiguous,
STOP and output only clarifying questions.
Do NOT generate a plan until those questions are answered.

If all required information is present,
generate the implementation plan for Phase <N>.

Context

Canonical architecture files:

docs/canonical/AGENT_ENGINE_OVERVIEW.md

docs/canonical/AGENT_ENGINE_SPEC.md

docs/canonical/PROJECT_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md

docs/operational/PLAN_BUILD_AGENT_ENGINE.md

These documents provide the only authoritative definitions of:

valid semantics

routing rules

node roles and behaviors

schema definitions

execution constraints

phase requirements

They override existing code and any other documents.
Conflicts must resolve in favor of the canonical documents.
Do NOT reinterpret or infer beyond their contents.

Additional reference document:

docs/canonical/RESEARCH.md —
This document provides background only.
Canonical documents ALWAYS override RESEARCH.md.
If canonical details are missing, you MUST ask clarifying questions rather than infer from research notes.

Task
STEP 1 — Validate Inputs

Determine whether all information required for Phase <N> is fully specified.

Check for:

Completeness of Phase <N> description in PLAN_BUILD_AGENT_ENGINE.md

No ambiguities in modules, behaviors, invariants, file paths, schemas, or semantics

No contradictions across canonical documents

No missing architectural requirements

STEP 2 — If any information is missing

STOP immediately.

Output exactly:

Clarifying Questions for Phase <N>:
1. …
2. …


No prose, no steps, no sections. End output.

STEP 3 — If all information is present

Produce ONLY the file:

PHASE_<N>_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md


The file must contain:

SECTION 1 — Phase Summary
SECTION 2 — Requirements & Invariants
SECTION 3 — LLM Implementation Plan (no code, no human steps)
SECTION 4 — Acceptance Criteria
SECTION 5 — Clarifying Questions (if none, explicitly say none)

No additional text outside the file block.

Strict Constraints

Do NOT write code.

Do NOT generate a plan unless ALL information is present.

Do NOT invent missing details.

Do NOT add new semantics or patterns.

Do NOT modify or reinterpret canonical architecture or the build plan.

Do NOT output reasoning or commentary beyond the required structure.

Output NOTHING except what the Output Format specifies.

Output Format
If insufficient information:
Clarifying Questions for Phase <N>:
1. …
2. …

If sufficient information:

Output only the contents of:

PHASE_<N>_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
<markdown content>


Nothing before or after.
